# Class 1 notes
- Event Loop: Executes taks in a queue. 

- Solving Problems: Don't try to overcomplicate problem solving. Start with the simpilest terms or processes, and evolve the solving from there. Trying to grab too much at once, or solve the entire problem in one swoop often leads to failure. 

- Super Mario Effect: choose to approach learning in a way that is motivating for you. THe mindset used to learn best should be applied when receiving new information. 

- The 5 Whys: ask why 5 times (sometimes more, sometimes less) Get to the RCA of the problem before you stop asking why. 

- Act like you make $1k an Hour: your time is valuable. Treat it as such, and ensure others treat your time with respect, too.
