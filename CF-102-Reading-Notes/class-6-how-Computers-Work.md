## How Computers Works

**4 Functions of a Computer**

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

**What makes a Computer Work?**

-Computers receive electrical inputs calculated through processors using electrical nodes representing either a 1 or 0, which can be used to make any integer. These calculations are the instructions of output from the computer (Pictures, audio, response)

**Circuits**
-Circuits calculate the input and output of binary electrical code. The more circuits the faster the computation. The more complicated the computation, the more circuits and memory required. 

**Hardware and Software**
- Hardare physical material of computing
- Software virtual material of computing
-OS, the Operating System manages the Software communicating with the Hardware.
