# About Dion

Yo, my name is Dion(like the mustard). I enjoy eating pizza, working out so I can eat more pizza, and playing hide-n-seek with my dog. I love learning new things, and hope to take away enough from this course to make my visited webpages and applications even better. Here is to a brighter future through knowledge!
