## HTML & CSS Notes 
1. Local Storage
  - userData in web pages was limited by storage space. 
  - Several add-ons and browser extensions have been created to alleviate space constraints and browser speeds.
  - Browsers became too reliant on extensions by 3rd parties to run effectively, and were vulnerable to malicious hacks. 
1. HTML 5 Support 
  - HTML5 crates localStorage through object global window objects based on key value pairs. 
  - HTML 5 is still limited by storage space in the style of 5 megabytes. 
  - The additional space allows resumption of view if your browsing is interrupted or closed.
