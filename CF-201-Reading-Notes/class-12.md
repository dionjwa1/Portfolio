  - Transform Property: comes in 2 or three dimensional settings. 
    - 2D Transform Property: woks on the x axis and y axis. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, while using a negative value will rotate an element counter-clockwise. 
    - 2D Rotate Demo:
<!-- figure class="box-1">Box 1 figure -->
<!-- .box-1 {transform:rotate(20deg}; or .box-2 {transform:rotate(-55deg)}; -->

  - 2D Scale Demo: works
  <!-- figure  class="box-1">Box 1-->
  <!-- .box {trasnform: scale(.75)}; or .box-2 {transform: scale(1.25);} can also use scaleX or scaleY for axis specific scaling -->

  - 3D Transform Property: works on x, y, and z axes.
