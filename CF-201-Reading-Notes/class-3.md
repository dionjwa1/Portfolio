## HTML & CSSNotes 

    1. HTML Tags: tags build the structure and add semantics to the page. Content goes inside the tags. E.g., \<p> creates paragraph space, \<h1> creates a heading, \<hr /> creates a line break between paragraphs, \<cite> to cite work

    1. CSS- imagine there is an invisible box around every HTML tag. CSS allows you to create rultes within each invidual box.
        1. Do this by slecting a tag and making a declaration (color, size, font, border, etc. )
        1. Create multiple decliration within the same tag by adding ; after each declaration. 
        1. You can also add multiple sectors to the selections. E.g., h1, h2, h3 {}
