## HTML & CSS Notes 
 1. HTML Tags: tags build the structure and add semantics to the page. Content goes inside the tags. E.g., \<p> creates paragraph space, \<h1> creates a heading, \<hr /> creates a line break between paragraphs, \<cite> to cite work

    1. CSS- imagine there is an invisible box around every HTML tag. CSS allows you to create rultes within each invidual box.
        1. Do this by slecting a tag and making a declaration (color, size, font, border, etc. )
        1. Create multiple decliration within the same tag by adding ; after each declaration. 
        1. You can also add multiple sectors to the selections. E.g., h1, h2, h3 {}

## Java Notes 

    1. JS is a series of instrcuctions in the form of statements. Statements are organized into code blocks begining with the statement. 
        1. Statements are made of variable keywords and the variable name. They are connected through an operator.
        1. Once a variable has been created, you no longer need to use var . You can just write the variable name 
            1. Naming rule- name cannot begin with a number. You must use a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore and you cannot use an underscore or period in the name. You cannot use keywords or reservered words in the name.
