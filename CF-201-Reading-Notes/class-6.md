1. Objects: object group together sets of variable and function to create a model of something recognized in the real world. 
1. In an object, var and functions take on new names
  - var become properties, which tell us about the object(name, info, etc)
  - Functions become methods, which represent tasks associated with the object. 
  - keys are names 
  - values remain values
